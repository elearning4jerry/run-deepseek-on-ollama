# run-deepseek-on-ollama
to set up and run DeepSeek in your PC using Ollama

1. Download Ollama at https://ollama.com/download and install in your machine; I run on Windows for myself
2. After installation, open command prompt
3. Enter "Ollama --help", you will see a bunch of commands telling you what you can do with Ollama
4. Go to https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1, choose a model that your PC can afford to run.  I am running on the lightest version 1.5b
5. Copy the command from the url after you selected the model, paste it in cmd prompt and run it.  For my case, it will be "ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b"
